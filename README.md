## Description

Slangman is a play on the classic Hangman game, created for [Reddit's Games and Puzzles Hackathon](https://redditgamesandpuzzles.devpost.com/).

## How To Play

Slangman is a simple game that any Reddit user can jump into. 

The directions are simple:

1. Visit the [Slangman Playtest Subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/playtest_404/)
2. Click on the dropdown menu
3. Select 'Create Slangman Post'
4. Once your Slangman post has been created, click 'Play'.
5. Using the hint as your guide, type individual letters with your keyboard to guess the word

- Note: Just like classic Hangman, the Hangman figure will display more body parts with each incorrect letter guessed and the user loses the game when the Slangman figurine is complete. Unlike classic Hangman, Slangman features custom functionality so the number of guesses varies based on the length of the current word.
