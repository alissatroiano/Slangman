## Inspiration

Slangman is a US slang word game inspired by the classic game, 'Hangman'. Slangman's humorous (and sometimes explicit) dictionary of words was inspired by the fun, anonymous nature of the Reddit platform.

## What it does

Using Devvit's Menu actions, Slangman does the following: 
- Allows users to create a post containing the game, by selecting 'Create Slangman Post'.
- Notifies users they have successfully created a new game post, by displaying a toast reading, 'Created Slangman post!'.

Once the post has been generated, users may perform the following actions:
- Read directions on the initial screen, by clicking 'Directions'.
![Directions]()
- Trigger the game webview, by clicking 'Play'
![Play Buttton]()

Once the game webview is triggered, users can do the following with Slangman:
- Use the hint as a guide
- Enter individual letters by clicking on the text input field and typing the letter they want to guess.
- Start over, or choose a new word, by clicking the 'New Word' button.
- When the game is over, users may choose to Play Again by clicking on the, 'Play Again' button.

#### Hangman vs. Slangman

##### Similarities
- Much like classic Hangman, the Hangman figurine will render a new body part with each incorrect letter the user guesses. 
- The user loses the game when the Slangman figurine is complete and they are out of guesses. 

##### Differences
- Unlike classic Hangman, Slangman is **not limited to 8 guesses**. Because a lot of Gen Z words and phrases are abbreviated, Slangman was built with custom functionality, so the number of guesses varies based on the length of the current word.
- Slangman is animated, so he waves his arms around (in a comical cry for help from the user).

## How I built it

Slangman was built with the following tools and technologies:

- Devvit **[Webviews](https://developers.reddit.com/docs/webviews)** were used to integrate Slangman with Reddit's platform.

- [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) was used to build out the game's functionality.
  
- [HTML5](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/HTML5) was used to build the page where the game renders. 

- [CSS3](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) was used to apply custom styles to Slangman

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/doc)

- [GitHub](https://github.com)
