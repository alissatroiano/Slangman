## Description

Slangman is a word game created for [Reddit's Games and Puzzles Hackathon](https://redditgamesandpuzzles.devpost.com/). Slangman was inspired by the classic game, 'Hangman'.

## How To Play

Slangman is a simple game that any Reddit user can jump into. 

The directions are simple:

1. Visit the [Slangman Playtest Subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/playtest_404/)
2. Click on the dropdown menu
3. Select 'Create Slangman Post'
4. Once your Slangman post has been created, click 'Play'.
5. Using the hint as your guide, type individual letters with your keyboard to guess the word

_**Note**: Much like classic Hangman, the Hangman figurine will display more body parts with each incorrect letter the user guesses. The user loses the game when the Slangman figurine is complete and they are out of guesses. Unlike the classic Hangman game, Slangman is not limited to 8 guesses. Because a lot of Gen Z words and phrases are abbreviated, Slangman was built with custom functionality, so the number of guesses varies based on the length of the current word._
