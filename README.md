# Slangman

## Description

Slangman is a play on the classic Hangman game, created for [Reddit's Games and Puzzles Hackathon](https://redditgamesandpuzzles.devpost.com/).

## How To Play

Slangman is a simple game that any Reddit user can ump into. The directions are simple:
1. Visit the [Slangman Playtest area](https://www.reddit.com/r/playtest_404/)
2. Click on the dropdown menu
3. Select 'Create Slangman Post'
4. Once your Slangman post has been created, click 'Play'.
5. Using the hint as your guide, type individual letters with your keyboard to guess the word (Note: like classic Hangman, the Hangman figure will display body parts with each incorrect guess. Unlike classic Hangman, Slangman features custom functionality so the number of guesses varies based on the length of the current word).
